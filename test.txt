Whispering spring rain,  
Soft petals wake, unfolding—  
Morning breathes anew.  

Gentle winds do sweep,  
Carrying distant stories—  
Life stirs in the light.  

River folds its song,  
Worn by time and memory,  
Stones glisten with hope.  

Under timeless skies,  
Roots and longing intertwine,  
Dreams echo through leaves.
